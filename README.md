### Project Overview
Welcome to Part 4 of the Maji Ndogo series, "From Analysis to Action: Charting the Course for Maji Ndogo's Water Future". This project focuses on transforming raw water data into actionable insights that can guide decision-makers in addressing water-related challenges in the region. Through SQL data querying, you will extract relevant information, analyze it, and prepare comprehensive reports that influence strategic planning and resource allocation.

In this part of the project, our objective is to answer key questions using the data collected from the Maji Ndogo region. We aim to:

1. Examine water source distribution across provinces and towns.
2. Identify specific water-related issues, such as broken water taps in homes.
3. Measure water source usage and pollution levels, specifically from wells.
4. Provide clear, data-driven directions for engineers and decision-makers to resolve identified issues.
